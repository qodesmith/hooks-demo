# React Hooks!

#### Why I'll Never Write A Class Again (almost)

The awesomeness has arrived, otherwise known as [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). In this short demo, I'll give an introduction to React hooks, what they're useful for, and why I'll (almost) never need to use a class for React components again.


_NOTE: This repo contains the application I built to demonstrate React Hooks. Checkout the other repo with the [presentation slides](https://github.com/qodesmith/hooks-presentation) as well._


This project was created with [Create New App](https://github.com/qodesmith/create-new-app).
